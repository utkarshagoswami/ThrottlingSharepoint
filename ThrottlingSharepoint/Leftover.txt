1. Catch on exception, reverse the transaction for that record and move onto next record. Store this in "failures" file
2. Error handling for throttling by sharepoint. Shrepoint sends a 503 error when throttling
3. Fetch sharepointdocumentlocation related to only the entityLogicalName given by user instead of fetching all sharepointdocumentlocations
4. Can we use batch call to update the DLs to save time? How else can we save time?
5. Write a script to delete the files if the customer is comfortable

Happy coding!
